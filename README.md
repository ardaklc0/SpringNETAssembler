# BussMaker

BussMaker is an automated tool designed to streamline the setup process for MVC applications in C# and Java by automating the creation of Services, Repositories, and Data Transfer Objects based on user-defined entities.

## Description

Creating an MVC application in C# or Java often involves a time-consuming process of setting up boilerplate code for Services, Repositories, and Data Transfer Objects. BussMaker simplifies this process by automating the creation of these components. Users only need to define an entity and its fields, and the program generates the necessary code.

## Installation

To use BussMaker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary .NET dependencies installed.

## Usage

Using BussMaker is straightforward:

1. Access the home page.
2. Redirect to the "Create Entity" section.
3. Define a new entity by providing a name and specifying its fields.
4. Navigate to the "Show All Entities" page.
5. Click the "Generate" button to view the auto-generated code.
